The amount of work done/that needs to be done per Sprint is captured in the total amount of story points within that Sprint. The QA Team, like the engineering teams, will be using a point system based on the Fibonacci Sequence. Story Point goals will be assigned in the beginning of each Sprint and should divide fairly equally between the QA Team members.

|**QA Story Points Table**|
|Points|Definition of Effort|Example|
|------|--------------------|-------|
|1|Something that takes very little intellectual effort and can be done relatively quickly.|Creating a new bug ticket.|
|2|Something that requires documentation, but perhaps in a pre-made template.|EOD Reports and Breakdowns. Updating and modifying documentation.|
|3|A task that requires some time and critical thought.|Creating new documents. IE. External Platform Publish Behavior Outline|
|5|A task requires several hours of execution and research and can span more than a day.|A full and thorough sweep on a regression test suite for both OS 7 and OS 8.|
|8|A project that takes critical thought and research and spans more than a day|Adding fix versions to every ticket lacking the label and updating documents requiring that piece of information.|
|13|A large project that could be separated into different subtasks, often spanning more than a day to complete.|Adding pages, files, and materials to complete a specific child page of the QA Testing Space in Confluence.|
