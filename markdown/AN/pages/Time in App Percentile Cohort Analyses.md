## Goal

The goal of this analysis is to identify the super fans or the most engaged users measured by the time in app and study their behaviors. The metrics we measure are retention, time in app, engagements (comments, reposts, likes, poll responses, ballistics), creations on an aggregate as well as per user per day/week/month basis. Once we understand what behaviors or loops drive a user to become a super fan, we can attempt to influence other users to do so by taking them through those loops or naturally getting them to perform those actions through product design/UI/UX.

## Methodology

__Step 1: Choose App__

We chose __Ryan Higa__ to perform this deep dive analysis. There were a number of observations but the key takeaways are in the section below.

__Step 2: Segment Users by Time in App percentile__

* Super fans: P99 time in app (top 1% of users)
* Casual fans: P50 time in app (median users) 

__Step 3: Compare Key Metrics__

* Time in app – sessions per day, session length
*  Retention – D1, D7, D14
*  Creation funnel - % creator, creations per creator
*  Engagement funnel (EB, comments, reposts) - % engagers, engagements per creator 

## Results

There were a number of very interesting observations and results. They can be found in the tableau workbook below.

The summary can be found in the deck below.

## Key Takeaways

* Super fans spend 6X more time in app per day than casual fans (3.3 min per day). This is primarily driven by sessions per day (session frequency) and not minutes per session (session length).
* Super fans create 6X more than casual fans and 3X more on a per creator basis than casual fans. Images dominate these creations.
* Super fans are 2X more likely to throw EBs, 7X more likely to respond to polls, 6.5X more likely to comment and 10X more likely to repost than casual fans. In general super fans are most characterized by engagements and creations.
* Super fans have 90% D1, 70% D7 and 60% D14 compared to 30% D1, 10% D7 and 5% D14 for casual fan.
* Following (at least in its current state) does not seem to impact retention of super fan behavior in itself.
* Engagement with messaging increases over time - this is concentrated around super fans.

## Next Steps

Drill further session activity to understand core loop

* Old: Analyze session activity for small set of users (P99 vs. P50 time in app)  * Results likely correlate with existing cohort analysis.
  *  Results heavily weighted towards activity early in the user’s life
  
  



* New: Analyze activity trends for n-day returner (1, 7, 14, 30)  *  Understand how user behavior evolves over time for users that return n-days after install 
  *  What do users do in the app that gets them to come back in the long term?
