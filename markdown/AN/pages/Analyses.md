Below are the links to the completed by the Analytics team as well as a brief summary on the drivers for these analyses. (Additional past analyses to be added - 2/2/2016)

- - -**[User Funnel Analysis](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A2LFyqQmjQcgfRKGmQSKPtwrvuAdAu7HFcMj9ngtI1M/edit#slide=id.ga24205b28_0_0)** - *Completed on 11/2015*

Performed to understand __what the user funnel look in the first hour after install, specifically on engagements and creations__. After a user installs, about 94% of users start the registration flow and this drops down to 76% that experience a tile view. In order of frequency, users will throw an EB, like, follow, comment, share. There is value in getting more users to engage in some of the more lightweight actions earlier in their life cycle.

- - -**[First Session Analysis](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RxhEMFxTOyAtcnc9kqnTwXzsOVlYX3hjtL8FFbzRJkI/edit#slide=id.ga24205b28_0_0)** - *Completed on 11/2015*

This is similar to the above analysis but focuses solely on the first session rather than the first hour. Once a user installs our app, __what does their first session look like? Where is the drop off? What is the last action done before the first session ends?__ The majority of actions that occur in the first session are either tile view or view (87%) and the majority of drop offs occur after a tile view. There is also a pretty significant drop off rate after the FTUE and Reg events.

- - -**[Likers and Ballistics Users Cohort Analysis](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JScOHo6nC1lKVju8xDCo-5RUKPEJz1QROAimfuR0GvM/edit#slide=id.ga24205b28_0_0)** - *Completed on 11/2015*

This analysis was completed to answer the question, __Are users that like or throw EBs more valuable?__. About 1/4th of users throw EB and about 1/5th of users like. Likers and EB Users demonstrate stronger performance in retention, creations, and time and sessions in app. There is a significant amount of overlap between the two cohorts.

- - -**[Creator vs. User Time in App](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15VLb3bPGODS2QJMwAuwiyMz4B6JN7XZsh6oCkGN_Umk/edit#slide=id.ga24205b28_0_0)** - *Completed on 12/2015*

Analysis was done to understand __If there is a correlation between the creator and user time spent in app?__ There is little connection between these two numbers both when comparing app to app and comparing on a daily basis (if a creator spends more time in app one day vs another, is the user time in app higher?). There is a slightly higher user time in app when the creator posts app exclusive content. Spikes in engagement also correspond with creator posts in the app (regardless of native or non-native content).

- - -[**App Label Cohort Analysis**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jPFpDVillALza_F5lHsJukK3hYAqvNX1_RQpQ8xJgm0/edit) - *Completed on 01/2016*

This analysis was completed to understand__ what are the characteristics that make some apps more successful based on a set of defined labels?__ Initial analysis was done on 17 apps that demonstrated a variety of success from throughout the network. Apps were labeled according some standard ones, like genre, demographic info, primary platform, and custom ones, like creator persona, community feel, focused/unfocused.

For the apps with the best initial retention, there is a focus on the content that is within an app on something that all the users are interested in, like soccer, learning English, or the creator(s). This focus seems to be helped by users posting more of their creations with hashtags, making it easier for other users to filter. There is also some additional social interaction among the users (either in higher follow rates or interactions among users). For apps with good long term retention, the best apps tend to be Utilitarian apps, those that help the users improve upon an aspect of their lives, like fitness or makeup. Additionally, apps from LatAm also perform well despite some other weakness indicators.

The apps that are the worst performers tend to have very little focus and the content in stream varies widely. There also seems to be weakness with Vine creators, which tend to skew more towards celebrity rather than engaging content for the users.
