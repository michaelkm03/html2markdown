iOS - All the iOS data comes from the Summary Sales Report in the iTunes connect portal. Calculate iOS sales as customer sales prices * conversion rate * units. 

Android - All the Android data comes from the Earnings Report in the Google Developer Portal. When this data is not available reporting mid month (i.e. for a board meeting), use the Sales Report and use the same conversion rate methodology used for iOS. Calculate Android sales as the sum of the "Amount (Merchant Currency)" column for charge and refund line items. Ignore all charge fee and refund fee line items.

For Conversion Rates, use the xe currency conversion site: [http://www.xe.com/currencytables/?from=USD](http://www.xe.com/currencytables/?from=USD). Navigate to the latest date in a particular month and use those conversion rates to represent the latest month by creating a reference table in the excel document for that month that you can reference. Google includes the converted amount in their report.
