In preparation for the 5.0 VIP launch, the BD and Analytics team worked together to create a stack ranking system to determine of a group of creators, which to prioritize as beta prospects. This methodology on the empirical side of this analysis is listed below. 

Prioritized Factors: 

* Desired Geographic Breakdown - Favoring US/Canada/UK 
* Gender Breakdown - Favoring females
* % comparison of past 90 to 30 Day sub growth compared to past 30 day to present sub growth - Favoring more recent growth  * This was calculated using the following formula:

* Dominant Content Platform - Favoring in the following order: YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Vine
* Genre - Favoring in the following order: Lifestyle, Gaming, Sports, Entertainment, Music  * This was determined 


* *OS breakdown - Favoring iOS users

For the first three prioritized factors, each of the creators were ranked against each other assigning points in descending order. (i.e. if there are three creators, the creator with the most female audience would receive 3 points and the one with the least would receive 1 point.) For the next two factors, the various potentials were scored with the most favorable with the highest points. (i.e. A creator who is most dominant on YouTube would receive 5 points, Facebook is 4 points, Instagram is 3 points, etc. If there are multiple creators all dominantly on YouTube, they would all receive 5 points.)

Once the points are assigned to all five categories, the five categories are summed for each creator and sorted from highest points to lower points to determine relative ranking. 

*OS breakdown was only considered for creators that have existing apps on the platform to determine user client breakdowns. It has been well proven that users on iOS devices / systems convert more readily than users on Android devices / systems. There was no scoring attributed to this but considered in the more theoretical part of this analysis.
