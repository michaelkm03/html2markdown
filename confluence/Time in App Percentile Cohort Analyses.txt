The metrics we measure are retention, time in app, engagements (comments, reposts, likes, poll responses, ballistics), creations on an aggregate as well as per user per day/week/month basis. Once we understand what behaviors or loops drive a user to become a super fan, we can attempt to influence other users to do so by taking them through those loops or naturally getting them to perform those actions through product design/UI/UX.</p><h2>Methodology</h2><p><u>Step 1: Choose App</u></p><p>We chose <u>Ryan Higa</u> to perform this deep dive analysis. There were a number of observations but the key takeaways are in the section below.</p><p><u>Step 2: Segment Users by Time in App percentile</u></p><ul><li>Super fans: P99 time in app (top 1% of users)</li><li><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Casual fans: P50 time in app (median users)&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><u>Step 3: Compare Key Metrics</u></p><ul><li><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Time in app </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">&ndash; </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">sessions per day, session length</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Retention </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">&ndash; </span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">D1, D7, D14</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Creation funnel - % creator, creations per creator</span></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Engagement funnel (EB, comments, reposts) - % engagers, engagements per creator&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h2>Results</h2><p>There were a number of very interesting observations and results.

This is primarily driven by sessions per day (session frequency) and not minutes per session (session length).</li><li>Super fans create 6X more than casual fans and 3X more on a per creator basis than casual fans. Images dominate these creations.</li><li>Super fans are 2X more likely to throw EBs, 7X more likely to respond to polls, 6.5X more likely to comment and 10X more likely to repost than casual fans. In general super fans are most characterized by engagements and creations.</li><li>Super fans have 90% D1, 70% D7 and 60% D14 compared to 30% D1, 10% D7 and 5% D14 for casual fan.</li><li>Following (at least in its current state) does not seem to impact retention of super fan behavior in itself.</li><li>Engagement with messaging increases over time - this is concentrated around super fans.</li></ul><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>Drill further session activity to understand core loop</p><ul><li>Old:&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Analyze session activity for small set of users (P99 vs. P50 time in app)</span><ul><li>Results likely correlate with existing cohort analysis.</li><li><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Results heavily weighted towards activity early in the user&rsquo;s life</span><br /><span style="line-height: 1.42857;"><br /></span></li></ul></li></ul><div class="page" title="Page 23"><div class="section"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><ul><li><span>New:&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Analyze activity trends for n-day returner (1, 7, 14, 30)</span><ul><li><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Understand how user behavior evolves over time for users that return n-days after install&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;What do users do in the app that gets them to come back in the long term?&nbsp;</span></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style="line-height: 1.42857;"><br /></span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></ac:confluence>
