The QA Team, like the engineering teams, will be using a point system based on the Fibonacci Sequence. Story Point goals will be assigned in the beginning of each Sprint and should divide fairly equally between the QA Team members.</p><table><tbody><tr><td class="highlight-blue" colspan="3" data-highlight-colour="blue"><strong>QA Story Points Table</strong></td></tr><tr><th>Points</th><th>Definition of Effort</th><th>Example</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Something that takes very little intellectual effort and can be done relatively quickly.</td><td>Creating a new bug ticket.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Something that requires documentation, but perhaps in a pre-made template.</td><td>EOD Reports and Breakdowns.
