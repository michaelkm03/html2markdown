As the nature of the contest changes each week, that dashboard will be updated routinely to determine the winner of the contest.&nbsp;</p><h1>The Leachy Peachy Award</h1><p>This award is based on randomly selecting a predetermined category either before or at the same time The Murali is awarded. Before it is awarded these categories are populated with the name of the respective winners in this document:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TbSEhTBAnG4JzzB2jwfPW4_uuyodts8ot-M7sb3L7Ck/edit#gid=0">Weekly Leachy Peachy Categories and Winners</a></li></ul><p>There are two sources used to updated the list of winners. There is a <a href="https://10ay.online.tableau.com/#/site/victorious/views/SurpriseContestWinners/MostSessionstimeandengagements?:iid=1">Tableau workbook</a> used to identify the winners related to session and overall engagements. Sort the individual fields to show the top user for the metric in that time period to determine the winner and add that name for that category into the &quot;Categories and Winners&quot; document.</p><p>The remaining set of the winners can be pulled using the following <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oy442oOM2xRJHpFAGMsjxjMvwMj9FUIgspJYucx07KM">queries</a> from mySQL. Please be sure to update the dates in the queries for the relevant time period. This can be done for the whole document at once using replace all. Run these queries to determine the category winners and add them to the &quot;Categories and Winners&quot; document.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>EDIT: This page is obsolete due to the retirement of these two awards as of 9/1/2016</p></ac:confluence>
